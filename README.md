# PriceQuoteApp

This is my PriceQuoteApp.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core**: Utilized to get IntelliSense on the MVC methods.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implemented to validate input fields.
- **Bootstrap**: Applied to enhance the appearance of input fields.

## Challenges
I encountered some difficulties getting the clear link to work properly.

## Features
- Calculates discount amount and total based on the subtotal and discount percentage entered by the user.
- Displays error messages for invalid input.
- Resets the form when the Clear link is clicked.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.
